# Basic Implementation
1. Create a box the same as the provided image
2. Each image after uploaded should be added to a list
3. Preview of the uploaded image should be placed in a list item
4. During upload show a progress bar
5. The ability to remove records should be implemented

# Upload Controlling
1. File browser dialogue should only show and select jpeg, jpg, gif or png.
2. The acceptable maximum file size should be 2mg.

# Performance Issues
1. After removing each image from the list the uploaded image also should be removed from the memory
2. Prevent from fetching while error by defining a properly signal
